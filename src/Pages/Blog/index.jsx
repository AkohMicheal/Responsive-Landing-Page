    title: 'The Future of Online Education',
    content: `
      <p>Online education has come a long way since its inception. What started as simple text-based courses has evolved into immersive learning experiences with video, interactive exercises, and even virtual reality.</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting developments in online education is the use of artificial intelligence to personalize learning experiences. AI algorithms can now analyze a student's strengths and weaknesses and adapt the curriculum accordingly.</p>
      <p>Another trend is the rise of microlearning - short, focused lessons that can be completed in just a few minutes. This approach is particularly effective for busy professionals who need to fit learning into their schedules.</p>
